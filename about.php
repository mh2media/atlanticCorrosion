<p><strong>Atlantic Consultants, Inc</strong>. was founded by Kerri Howell, P.E. in February 1998. Ms. Howell&#8217;s objective, in founding the firm, was to provide specialize consulting services in both Civil and Corrosion Engineering. With 27 years of experience, Ms. Howell has provided services in evaluation of existing facilities including pipelines, bridges, condominiums, water storage tanks, water and wastewater plant facilities, marine structures, transit facilities and equipment, fuel storage and other transportation facilities and equipment. She has also performed research and development of materials, equipment and systems for corrosion control. She has extensive experience in design of corrosion monitoring and control systems for pipelines, tanks, basins, atmospherically exposed structures, bridges, marine facilities and plant facilities and equipment, including coatings, linings and cathodic protection. She has developed standard specifications and details for corrosion monitoring and control as well as testing procedures for use in the preliminary design stage for a variety of water and wastewater agencies. Ms. Howell has overseen field testing and prepared reports for external corrosion direct assessment (ECDA) surveys for hundreds of miles of oil and gas pipelines.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p>Ms. Howell has over 27 years of civil and corrosion engineering experience including research, product development, planning, design and inspection, failure analysis and construction inspection in the transportation and corrosion control industries. Ms. Howell has extensive experience in corrosion evaluation, corrosion mitigation and cathodic protection of bridges, piers, docks, rail facilities and atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures, corrosion investigation of water and wastewater treatment facilities and piping, both for internal and external corrosion, steam, gas and fuel piping, design and evaluation of corrosion control systems for water and wastewater plants and pipelines, cathodic protection, material selection, coatings and linings, failure analysis, training and litigation/expert witness. Ms. Howell has served as the project manager for evaluation of hundreds of miles of existing water and fuel lines, utilizing ECDA testing procedures including CIS, DCVG, PCM and cell to cell surveys. She has provided detailed technical reports for these condition surveys including recommendations for mitigation of corrosion issues identified during the surveys and design of corrosion control and cathodic protection systems.</p>
