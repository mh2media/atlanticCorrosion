        Welcome to<br />
Atlantic Consultants, Inc.</h1>
<p><strong>We’re pleased introduce you to Atlantic Consultants, Inc.</strong> and to present our qualifications to you. Upon review of our qualifications, you will find that our staff has extensive experience in evaluation of existing transportation facilities, including bridges, marine structures and light rail facilities.</p>

<p><strong>In a report prepared for the National Association of Corrosion Engineers</strong> (NACE), titled “Highway Bridges”, the author indicates that 15% of the nation’s 600,000 bridges have degraded due to corrosion of the steel and reinforcing steel. The report identifies four areas in which there are technological gaps: training, the need for development of expert systems including data analysis and monitoring of coating degradation, condition assessment using non-destructive and other testing procedures, and selecting materials that provide more durable facilities with reduced operation and maintenance costs. Atlantic Consultants can provide assistance in all of these areas.</p>

<p><strong>Atlantic Consultants provides consulting services</strong> in the areas of corrosion, material selection, coatings and corrosion controlfor steel structures as well as reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures. Atlantic Consultants has performed corrosion inspections and training on bridge corrosion inspection in the following states; Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, and Virginia. Atlantic Consultants has also designed corrosion control systems and provided coating recommendations for both concrete and steel structures. Our collective backgrounds include licenses in Civil and Corrosion Engineering, chemical engineering, cement chemistry, materials engineering, and metallurgy. Atlantic Consultants’ engineering services include: evaluation, construction management and project oversight, training for Departments of Transportation personnel, expert witness in litigation and failure analysis. Atlantic Consultants provides a unique set of qualifications with respect to evaluation of existing transportation facilities and cost effective solutions where potential problems are identified that require mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>Ms. Howell, Mr. Tinnea and Mr. Bianchetti</strong> have worked jointly on numerous projects and have developed standards for several technical societies for more than 25 years. Atlantic Consultants would be pleased to provide references and are eager to discuss with you how we might be of assistance to your organization.<p>

<p class="final"><strong>We trust that you will find our expertise of extreme value</strong>. <br />
We welcome the opportunity to discuss any questions you may have.</p>
